# Personal_Finance_Advisor
This repo contains a small collection of code to track personal financial progress. The majority of the code (e.g. function definitions, explanations) are contained in the helpers python file. The notebook contains an example of how to use them to actually track one's savings progress, with ultimate output explaining how much money one can expect to have at a user-defined level of current savings, recurring annual savings, timeframe, tax bracket and expected average annual growth. There are default values for these inputs as well, with explanations for them included in the notebook. Please note that I am not a financial advisor, and this project is not meant to be used a substitute for professional financial advice.
